# React board games
App - https://flipee0.github.io/React-board-games/

This app allows you to play some board games. Right now you can only play chess, but checkers, tic-tac-toe and other games are planned to be added later.

In our chess you can play according to FIDE rules on one computer in hotseat format and against ai. Later it is planned to add the possibility to play online and also to add the possibility to play Fischer chess.

Right now the timer does not work in chess
